# HopeBridge — Climate Finance & Community Resilience Platform

**Live Deployment:** [https://hope-bridge-ten.vercel.app/](https://hope-bridge-ten.vercel.app/)

HopeBridge is a modern, high-fidelity web application and offline-first USSD gateway designed to bridge the gap between climate-disaster recovery needs, community resilience, and active funding pipelines in Kenya.

The platform is designed around a core thesis: **Climate disasters happen. Recovery funding exists. HopeBridge connects the two.** It serves as a unified marketplace for climate grants, mutual aid, step-by-step recovery plans, interactive hazard maps, and a fully featured operations portal for NGOs and local governments.

To showcase how critical aid reaches offline and disconnected rural communities, HopeBridge includes a fully interactive **USSD Mobile phone simulator** alongside the core web portal.

## Live Hackathon & Demo Sandbox (Zero-Setup Required)

**Hosted Demo:** You can access the live application at [hope-bridge-ten.vercel.app](https://hope-bridge-ten.vercel.app/).

The application features a built-in global **Demo Panel** (floating trigger at the bottom-right of the viewport) designed to showcase complex disaster and funding flows instantly without requiring third-party API keys, SMS gateway configurations, or live database setups:

- **USSD Feature Phone Simulator**:
  - Simulates a feature phone dialer interface running standard network codes (dial `*483*111#`).
  - **Auto-Play Script Demos**: Contains 5 one-click simulated flows:
    1.  _1. Report Damage_: Dials ➔ selects damage report ➔ submits ➔ dispatches automated **USSD Alert Gateway** SMS.
    2.  _2. Get Supplies_: Requests clean water/food ➔ submits ➔ dispatches **HopeBridge Logistics** confirmation ticket SMS.
    3.  _3. Climate Grants_ (New): Opens the climate grants flow ➔ selects grant ➔ verifies county ➔ submits ➔ dispatches a grant reference SMS.
    4.  _4. Find Shelter_: Searches shelters in `Kisumu` key-by-key ➔ returns capacity/calls ➔ dispatches shelter directory SMS.
    5.  _5. Talk to Chief_: Connects helpline ➔ dispatches Chief Nelson's advice SMS.
  - **Backdrop Dismissal & Navigation**: Clicking outside the simulator blurs the screen and returns to the app. A red **`← Back to App`** button is also available inside the dialer.
- **Animated Autofill Scenarios**:
  - **Nyando Flood** / **Turkana Drought**: Automatically redirects to the report page and triggers a typewriter-like animation that fills in coordinates, descriptions, and categories, then submits it.
- **SMS Toast Notification Engine**:
  - Displays floating simulated mobile push alerts (e.g., warnings from local chiefs, logistics updates, grant application confirmations, and M-Pesa STK success alerts) with high z-index stacking to overlay the screen.
- **M-Pesa STK Push Payment**:
  - When donating to relief campaigns or simulating beneficiary disbursements, typing PIN `1234` triggers a processing animation, registers success, and displays an inline confirmation box.

## Key Features

- **Climate Finance & Aid Marketplace** (`src/routes/funding.tsx`):
  - _Resilience & Adaptation Grants_: A centralized registry of active public/private grant opportunities in Kenya. Users can search and filter by 6 funding types (e.g., Cash Transfer, Rebuilding Grant, Adaptation Subsidy).
  - _Application Pipeline_: Direct application modal that verifies eligibility criteria, generates realistic submission records, and dispatches automated SMS confirmation notifications.
  - _Community Aid Campaigns_: Peer-to-peer mutual aid campaigns with a functional M-Pesa STK push simulation for secure community giving.
- **NGO & County Operations Portal** (`src/routes/operations.tsx`):
  - _Beneficiary Pipeline_: A queue-based manager for organization coordinators to track applicants from ingestion to verification and resolution. Offers actionable buttons to "Verify", "Disburse Funds" (triggering an M-Pesa push simulation), and "Resolve".
  - _Impact & Finance Analytics_: Interactive charts showing overall funds disbursed, active caseloads, regional fund distribution, and the ingestion channel split (USSD vs. Web).
  - _SaaS Pricing & Packages_: Commercial plans tailored for local NGOs (NGO Suite) and regional governments (County Enterprise License), including marketplace fee splits to ensure long-term platform sustainability.
- **Offline-First USSD Integration**: Enables offline or disconnected rural communities (e.g., Budalangi, Turkana) to request emergency supplies or apply directly for adaptation/recovery grants using basic feature phones.
- **Assistance Map (Interactive Leaflet Map)** (`src/routes/map.tsx`): Displays real-time locations of temporary shelters, distribution centers, and hazard locations. Features pulsing, scale-animated red hazard zones in active regions (e.g., Nyando, Lodwar).
- **Climate Recovery Blueprints** (`src/routes/_authenticated/dashboard.tsx`): Provides customized, step-by-step checklist action plans based on the user's local disaster risk (flooding, droughts, landslides, storms, etc.), immediately pairing them with active climate grants they qualify for.
- **Mutual Aid & Community Groups** (`src/routes/community.tsx`): Connects survivors with local community groups to coordinate volunteer labor, share tools, or distribute community-funded supplies.
- **Emergency Resource Guides** (`src/routes/resources.tsx`): Provides multi-chapter emergency manuals (housing, safety, medical, document recovery) tailored for Kenyan counties.

## Data Registry & Schemas

### Climate Finance Registry

Vetted funding opportunities are maintained in a structured static registry at [climateData.ts](file:///c:/Users/Tosh/Desktop/Climate%20Program/community-resilience-net/src/lib/climateData.ts). It includes 13 realistic Kenyan programs such as:

- _NDMA Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP)_ — Cash transfers for drought-affected households in Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, and Wajir.
- _Budalangi Flood Recovery Fund_ — Grants for home rebuilding in Busia County.
- _Safaricom Foundation MSME Resilience Grant_ — Emergency recovery funding for small businesses hit by climate shocks.
- _KENAFF Climate-Smart Seed Recovery Kit_ — Adaptation subsidies providing drought-resistant seed kits to farmers.
- _WFP Lean Season Cash Assistance_ — Food security relief cash for dry rural zones.

### Database Schemas (Supabase Integration)

If deployed with a live database backend, the schemas map to:

- `disaster_reports`: User-submitted damage metrics, severity ratings, and GPS coordinates.
- `aid_organizations`: Directory listings of vetted aid programs and NGO profiles.
- `assistance_centers`: Shelter coordinates, capacity numbers, and contact details.
- `support_groups`: Mutual-aid coordination threads and volunteer groups.
- `relief_updates`: Multi-channel broadcast alerts (SMS and Web notifications).
